a = (input("Enter a value! ")) #Just asking for user input

reverse = a[::-1]# I learn't this tool before and thought of it as I was messing with a different python expieriment in my free time and I learnt that this will litteraly just put something in reverse order

if( a == reverse ): 
    print("Yes it is palindrome! :)")
else:
    print("No it is not a palindrome! :(")
